CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Add 'algorithm' argument to all "findOverlaps" methods 

    o Rsamtools scanBamFlag isSecondaryAlignment replaces isNotPrimaryRead


MODIFICATIONS

    o Clarify use of 'fragments' in summarizeOverlaps() man page

    o Resync with replacement of RangeAE and RangeAEAE C data structs
      with IntPairAE and IntPairAEAE in S4Vectors 0.5.4

    o Modify show() for GAlignments objects to display a shorter
      version of long CIGARs

    o Rename mapCoords() argument 'from' -> 'x' 

    o Rename mapCoords() argument 'to' -> 'alignment' 

    o Rename mapCoords() metadata cols:
      queryHits -> fromHits
      subjectHits -> toHits

    o Move internal utility makeclassinfoRowForCompactPrinting() to S4Vectors

    o Change 'algorithm' default from "intervaltree" to "nclist" in
      findOverlaps-based methods

    o All "findOverlaps" methods now support 'select' equal "last" or
      "arbitrary" as well as "all" and "first"

    o Add 'algorithm' argument to summarizeOverlaps(), 
      findCompatibleOverlaps(), countCompatibleOverlaps() and
      findSpliceOverlaps()

    o Remove redundant "findOverlaps" methods:
      GAlignments#GRangesList (keep GAlignments#Vector)
      GRangesList#GAlignments (keep Vector#GAlignments)

    o Add "mapToGenome", "pmapToGenome", "mapToTranscript" and 
      "pmapToTranscript" methods

    o Use auto-extending buffers in coordinate mapping code

    o Remove static declaration from next_cigar_OP() so it can be used
      in other compilation units

    o Rename next_cigar_OP() to _next_cigar_OP()

    o Add "mapFromAlignments" and "pmapFromAlignments" methods

    o "mapToGenome" methods use name matching to determine map pairs

    o Deprecate readGAlignment*FromBam() functions in favor of 
      readGAlignments(), readGAlignmentPairs(), readGAlignmentsList() and
      readGappedReads()

    o Coordinate mapping:
      - change seqname for non-hits from 'unmapped' to 'UNMAPPED'
      - range representing non-hits is 0,-1 (no overlap with 1-based ranges)

    o Deprecate "mapCoords" methods

    o Add examples describing the "duplicated record selection" problem
      as a follow-up to discussion on bioc-devel

    o Add checks and more helpful error message for summarizeOverlaps() when
      "file does not exist"

    o Replace rowData argument with rowRanges

BUG FIXES

    o Fix off-by-one error when processing 'S' in query_locs_to_ref_locs() 

    o Fix definition of summarizeOverlaps() generic 
      (was nonstandardGenericFunction) 


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Add 'preprocess.reads' argument to "summarizeOverlaps" methods

    o Add links to BAM file videos 

    o Add alphabetFrequencyFromBam() 

MODIFICATIONS

    o Export GappedReads() constructor 

    o Replace extractTranscriptsFromGenome() with extractTranscriptSeqs() 

    o vignette enhancements:
      - add paragraph on yieldSize / parallel processing
      - use assay(.) rather than assays(.)$count
      - MIAME(.) rather than new("MIAME", .)

    o Clarify contents of 'colData' on summarizedOverlaps() man page

    o coverage,Bamfile-method now returns empty RleList rather than NULL 

    o Add recommended biocViews 

    o Update "map" methods documentation to clarify 'RangesMapping'
      class was moved from IRanges to GenomicRanges and renamed 'GRangesMapping'

    o Add "mapCoords", "pmapCoords"

    o Defunct "map", "pmap" (skip deprecation) 

    o Speedup "[" method for GAlignmentPairs objects by 35% 

    o Rename internal helper fillGaps() -> fillJunctionGaps()

    o Follow renaming of TranscriptDb class -> TxDb

    o Follow List move from IRanges to S4Vectors 

    o Modify show() for GAlignments, GAlignmentPairs, and GAlignmentsList
      classes to print a 1-line summary of seqinfo instead of the seqlengths

BUG FIXES

    o Bug fix in flipQuery()

    o Fix issue with show() for GAlignments and GAlignmentPairs objects
      when 'showHeadLines' global option is set to Inf

    o Update precomputed exbytx object used in OverlapEncodings.Rnw vignette


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------

The first version of GenomicAlignments was included in Bioconductor 2.14. 
The package was created from existing code in IRanges, ShortRead, 
Rsamtools and GenomicRanges. 

NEW FEATURES

    o coverage,BamFile-method uses \code{yieldSize} to iterate through 
      large files

    o coverage,character-method calculates coverage from a BAM file
